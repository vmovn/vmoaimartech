/**
 * Centralised helper for tearing down and re-establishing Supabase Realtime
 * channels around an organization switch.
 *
 * Contract:
 *  - `resetRealtimeForOrgSwitch()` removes every channel currently open on
 *    the browser Supabase client and broadcasts a `swiffer:realtime-reset`
 *    event that hooks listen to via `useRealtimeGeneration()`.
 *  - Hooks that own a `supabase.channel(...)` subscription include the
 *    generation counter in their `useEffect` dependencies so the effect
 *    tears down the previous channel and re-subscribes with the new
 *    org-scoped filter as soon as the switch pipeline finalises.
 *
 * The pipeline calls this twice — once during the "clearing" phase to
 * silence org-A traffic before the cache is purged, and once during
 * "finalizing" so that any late channels that spun up during teardown are
 * cleaned before subscribers rebuild against org-B.
